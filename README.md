# Recollect

People always say -- writing something down is the best way to remember it -- and we figured typing it would be too! Transcribing lectures is nothing new, but a more interesting idea was taking that transcription, summarizing it, and then letting you type it out in a MonkeyType style browser game! 

Built with React, Flask, Cohere API, Google Speech-To-Text API, and ffmpeg/moviepy for DeerHacks 2024!
